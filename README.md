# CircleCI PHP images with MySQL and php-intl

These are standard CircleCI images for PHP 7.0+, but they contain some additional packages, namely MySQL support, the PHP intl extension and [Dockerize](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize).

We use these images for our continious integration for our Yii2 applications.

Feel free to copy or modify these (simple) additions.
