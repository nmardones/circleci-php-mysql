# CircleCI PHP images with MySQL and php-intl

These are standard CircleCI images for PHP 7.0+, but they contain some additional packages, namely MySQL support and the PHP intl extension.

We use these images for our continious integration for our Yii2 applications.

Feel free to copy or modify these (simple) additions.
